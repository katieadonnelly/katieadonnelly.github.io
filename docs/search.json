The map represents 2010 US Census data, showing the racial/ethnic data at the census tract level. User’s can select their variable of interest via a drop down menu, as well as adjust the range of interest to calibrate the visualization to their needs.\n\n\nStock Market Data Dashboard Here is another example of the types of interactive dashboards I can create for clients. In this dashboard, users can input a stock of their choice, using the three letter stock symbol. The chart will then display the stock price over time. Users have the option to plot along a log scale or adjust for inflation in the visualization."
